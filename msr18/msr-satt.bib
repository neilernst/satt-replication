  Abstract = {The popularity of mobile apps continues to grow over the past few
  years. Mobile app stores, such as the Google Play Store and Apple's App Store
  provide a unique user feedback mechanism to app developers through the
  possibility of posting app reviews. In the Google Play Store (and soon in the
  Apple App Store), developers are able to respond to such user feedback. Over
  the past years, mobile app reviews have been studied excessively by
  researchers. However, much of prior work (including our own prior work)
  incorrectly assumes that reviews are static in nature and that users never
  update their reviews. In a recent study, we started analyzing the dynamic
  nature of the review-response mechanism. Our previous study showed that
  responding to a review often has a positive effect on the rating that is given
  by the user to an app. In this paper, we revisit our prior finding in more
  depth by studying 4.5 million reviews with 126,686 responses for 2,328 top
  free-to-download apps in the Google Play Store. One of the major findings of
  our paper is that the assumption that reviews are static is incorrect. In
  particular, we find that developers and users in some cases use this response
  mechanism as a rudimentary user support tool, where dialogues emerge between
  users and developers through updated reviews and responses. Even though the
  messages are often simple, we find instances of as many as ten user-developer
  back-and-forth messages that occur via the response mechanism. Using a
  mixed-effect model, we identify that the likelihood of a developer responding
  to a review increases as the review rating gets lower or as the review content
  gets longer. In addition, we identify four patterns of developers: 1)
  developers who primarily respond to only negative reviews, 2) developers who
  primarily respond to negative reviews or to reviews based on their contents,
  3) developers who primarily respond to reviews which are posted shortly after
  the latest release of their app, and 4) developers who primarily respond to
  reviews which are posted long after the latest release of their app. We
  perform a qualitative analysis of developer responses to understand what
  drives developers to respond to a review. We manually analyzed a statistically
  representative random sample of 347 reviews with responses for the top ten
  apps with the highest number of developer responses. We identify seven drivers
  that make a developer respond to a review, of which the most important ones
  are to thank the users for using the app and to ask the user for more details
  about the reported issue. Our findings show that it can be worthwhile for app
  owners to respond to reviews, as responding may lead to an increase in the
  given rating. In addition, our findings show that studying the dialogue
  between user and developer can provide valuable insights that can lead to
  improvements in the app store and user support process.}, Author = {Hassan,

  abstract={Leave-one-out cross-validation (LOO) and the widely
  applicable information criterion (WAIC) are methods for estimating pointwise
  out-of-sample prediction accuracy from a fitted Bayesian model using the
  log-likelihood evaluated at the posterior simulations of the parameter values.
  LOO and WAIC have various advantages over simpler estimates of predictive
  error such as AIC and DIC but are less used in practice because they involve
  additional computational steps. Here we lay out fast and stable computations
  for LOO and WAIC that can be performed using existing simulation draws. We
  introduce an efficient computation of LOO using Pareto-smoothed importance
  sampling (PSIS), a new procedure for regularizing importance weights. Although
  WAIC is asymptotically equal to LOO, we demonstrate that PSIS-LOO is more
  robust in the finite case with weak priors or influential observations. As a
  byproduct of our calculations, we also obtain approximate standard errors for
  estimated predictive errors and for comparing of predictive errors between two
  models. We implement the computations in an R package called 'loo' and
  demonstrate using models fit with the Bayesian inference package Stan.},
